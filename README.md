# simple-smtp-client-server
This was a project I worked on in my Intro to Internet Services and Protocols class. It includes a simple SMTP client and server.

how to run:
Server.py

<code>python Server.py \<port\></code>

Client.py

<code>python Client.py \<host\> \<port\></code>

messages should be forwarded to <code>/forward/\<host\></code>
